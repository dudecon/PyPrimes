# PyPrimes
Python generated Prime numbers up to 4,295,500,000
This is enough prime numbers to validate the primeness of any 64 bit number.
Broken up into 500k chunks for ease of viewing and processing.

PrimeFinder.py is the old slow single-thread solution.

PrimeBatchFinder.py is multithreaded and way faster somehow. Not sure what I did wrong with the first try. Not even sure what I'm doing wrong now!
